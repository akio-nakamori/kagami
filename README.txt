Kagami
---------------------------------------------------------

Kagami is my personal project that have one goal: simplify interaction with images (also animations) on Twitter.

Let me explain:
When there is a tweet with awesome image/video You click 'Like' - wouldn't it be awesome if each time you click "Like" its really "Like&Save&Follow"?

This why Kagami was created.

Kagami will download images/animation and save metadata of that tweet like: text, author, tweet_id inside SQLite database.
